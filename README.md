# Nanobot - Build MCP Agents

> **Warning**
> This project is under heavy development and is moving away from its original design and intent. Expect significant breaking changes, architectural shifts, and evolving APIs.

Nanobot enables building agents with MCP and MCP-UI by providing a flexible MCP host.
While existing applications like VSCode, Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT, and Goose all include an MCP host,
Nanobot is designed to be a standalone, open-source MCP host that can be easily deployed or integrated into
your applications. You can use Nanobot to create your own dedicated MCP and MCP-UI powered chatbot.

## What is an MCP Host?

An [MCP host](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/architecture/index#host) is
the service that combines MCP servers with an LLM and context to present an agent experience to a
consumer. The primary experience today is a chat interface, but it can be many other interfaces such
as voice, SMS, e-mail, AR/VR, Slack, MCP, or any other interface that can be used to interact with
an agent.

## Examples

Here are some examples of Nanobots in action:
- [Blackjack Game](https://blackjack.nanobot.ai) [(config)](./examples/blackjack.yaml) [(mcp source)](https://github.com/nanobot-ai/blackjack)
- [Hugging Face MCP](https://huggingface.nanobot.ai) [(config)](./examples/huggingface.yaml)
- [Shopping/Shopify](https://shopping.nanobot.ai) [(config)](./examples/shopping.yaml)

## Installation

Nanobot can be installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install nanobot-ai/tap/nanobot
```

This will give you the `nanobot` CLI, which you can use to run and manage your MCP host.

---

## Getting Started

### Quickstart

1. Install the CLI:

   ```bash
   brew install nanobot-ai/tap/nanobot
   ```

2. Create a minimal config file:

   ```yaml
   # nanobot.yaml
   agents:
     main:
       name: Hello Agent
       model: gpt-4.1
       mcpServers: []
   ```

3. Run Nanobot:

   ```bash
   nanobot run ./nanobot.yaml
   ```

4. Open the UI at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

---

## Configuration

Nanobot supports two configuration formats:

1. **Single File Configuration** - A `nanobot.yaml` file
2. **Directory-Based Configuration** - A directory with `.md` agent files

### Single File Configuration

Nanobot supports the following providers:

- **OpenAI** (e.g. `gpt-4`)
- **Anthropic** (e.g. `claude-3`)

To use them, set the corresponding API key:

```bash
# For OpenAI models
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# For Anthropic models
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

Nanobot automatically selects the correct provider based on the model specified.

---

Create a configuration file (e.g. `nanobot.yaml`) that defines your agents and MCP servers.

**Example:**

```yaml
agents:
  dealer:
    name: Blackjack Dealer
    model: gpt-4.1
    mcpServers: blackjackmcp

mcpServers:
  blackjackmcp:
    url: https://blackjack.nanobot.ai/mcp
```

Start Nanobot with:

```bash
nanobot run ./nanobot.yaml
```

The UI will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### Directory-Based Configuration

Instead of using a `nanobot.yaml` file, you can organize your configuration as a directory structure where each agent is defined in its own `.md` file with YAML front-matter.

**Directory Structure:**

```
my-config/
├── agents/              # Agent definitions directory
│   ├── main.md          # Main agent (auto-set as entrypoint)
│   └── helper.md        # Additional agent
└── mcp-servers.yaml     # MCP server definitions
```

**Agent File Format (`agents/main.md`):**

```markdown
---
name: Shopping Assistant
model: claude-3-7-sonnet-latest
mcpServers:
  - store
temperature: 0.7
---

You are a helpful shopping assistant.

Help users find products and answer their questions.
```

The YAML front-matter supports all agent configuration fields (model, name, mcpServers, tools, temperature, etc.), and the markdown body becomes the agent's instructions.

**MCP Servers File (`mcp-servers.yaml` or `mcp-servers.json`):**

```yaml
store:
  url: https://example.com/mcp
  headers:
    Authorization: Bearer ${MY_TOKEN}
```

**Usage:**

```bash
nanobot run ./my-config/
```

**Features:**

- **Agent directory**: All agent `.md` files must be in the `agents/` subdirectory
- **Auto-entrypoint**: If `agents/main.md` exists, it's automatically set as the default agent
- **Agent ID**: Use the `id` field in front-matter, or defaults to the filename (without `.md`)
- **README.md**: Automatically ignored in the `agents/` directory (use it for documentation)

See the [directory-config example](./examples/directory-config/) for a complete working example.

## Development & Contribution

Contributions are welcome! Nanobot is still in **alpha**, so expect active development and rapid changes.

### Build from Source

```bash
make
```

### CLI Basics

Common commands:

```bash
nanobot run ./nanobot.yaml
nanobot run ./my-config/
nanobot help
```

### Working on the UI

The Nanobot UI lives in the `./ui` directory. To develop against it:

1. Remove the old build artifacts:

   ```bash
   rm -rf ./ui/dist
   ```

2. Rebuild the Nanobot binary:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. Start the UI in development mode:

   ```bash
   cd ui
   npm run dev
   ```

4. The UI must be served from port **5173**.\
   Nanobot runs on port **8080** and will forward UI requests to `:5173`.

### Troubleshooting

- **UI not loading**: Ensure the UI dev server is running on port **5173** and the backend is on **8080**.
- **Missing API keys**: Confirm `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is exported before running `nanobot run`.
